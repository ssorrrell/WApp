At present, there are three ways to obtain images from the RIDGE radar.

    Grunt method. Use the overlay toggles and "right click" on each layer to save it to the local computer. Remember, this only saves the right-most image as indicated by the toggle bar.
    Screen Capture. Use the toggle overlays to configure the image then use a screen capture utility to save the image to the local computer. This saves the steps needed to stack the images onto of each other in a graphics program and is also how all the RIDGE images used in this section were obtained.
    Download the individual files. All RIDGE radar images are downloadable and all that is needed is the URL. The table (below) provides the paths to each image. For the radar image, legend, or warnings images, the most recent graphic available ends in "_0.gif". For example, the most recent radar image for the Fort Worth Doppler radar is...
    http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/RadarImg/N0R/FWS_N0R_0.gif
    To view and retrieve the 20 most recent radar images then the URL is...
    http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/RadarImg/N0R/FWS/
    The filename format for these recent images is: xxx_YYYYMMDD_hhmm_N??.gif, where
    xxx - Radar site ID
    YYYY - year
    MM - month
    DD - day
    hh - hour
    mm - minutes
    N?? - image ID (N0R, N0S, etc.)
